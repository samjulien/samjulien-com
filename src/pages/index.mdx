# Hi, I'm Sam! ðŸ‘‹

It's really nice to meet you. I'm a director of Developer Relations (prev. [Auth0](http://www.auth0.com)), an instructor for [egghead](http://www.egghead.io), and the author of [Getting Started in Developer Relations](http://www.gettingstartedindevrel.com). I live in the PNW with my family and our scruffy doggo and love spending time in the woods whenever I can.

Growing in your career as a developer or developer advocate is not easy. I'm here to help you as best I can, not by giving you vague motivational speeches, but by sharing practical **microskills** that compound and become transformative.

If you're just getting to know me, start here:

Looking forward to getting to know you!

## Books & Courses

I also write books and make video courses! I love making complex topics accessible to new learners.
