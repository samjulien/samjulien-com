# Hi, I'm Sam! ðŸ‘‹

It's really nice to meet you.

Learning to code is hard, getting a job in tech is hard, and growing your career is hard. I'm here to help you as best I can, not by giving you vague motivational speeches that ignore big issues, but by sharing **microskills** I've learned that can compound and become transformative. For example:

<div className="flex sm:flex-row flex-col -my-5">

- [How to network for a better job](/shy-dev-networking)
- [How to manage time better](/managing-time-as-a-developer-advocate)
- [How to learn more efficiently](/learning-system-talk)
- [How to ask for feedback](/how-to-ask-for-feedback)
- [How to self-mentor](/how-to-self-mentor)
- [How to review your progress](/how-to-review-your-progress)
- [How to finish what you start](/how-to-finish-what-you-start)

<div className="sm:ml-2 ml-0 w-40 flex items-center justify-center">
  <img src="/signpost.svg" alt="signpost icon" />
</div>

</div>

Take what's helpful for you, discard the rest. If you like these, [sign up for the Developer Microskills newsletter](#subscribe) at the bottom of the page.

During the day, I lead Developer Relations at [Auth0](http://www.auth0.com). I'm also an instructor for [Thinkster](http://www.thinkster.io) and [egghead](http://www.egghead.io). I live in the PNW with my wife and our scruffy doggo and love spending time in the woods whenever I can.

If you'd like to talk closer to real time, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samjulien) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/samjulien).
