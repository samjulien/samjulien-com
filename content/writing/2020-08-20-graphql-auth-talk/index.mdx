Thanks for checking out my talk "Becoming a Secret Agent: Securing Your GraphQL APIs with JWTs." I hope you found it helpful!

You can find the most recent version of the slides [up on Speakerdeck here](https://speakerdeck.com/samjulien/becoming-a-secret-agent-securing-your-graphql-backend-with-jwts).

Here's the recording of the version of this talk I gave at [GraphQL Asia 2020](https://graphql.asia/):

I've also got a fullstack example of this using [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) you can check out, too:
