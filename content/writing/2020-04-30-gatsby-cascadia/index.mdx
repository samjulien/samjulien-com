I wasn't really enjoying the boring monospace font for my code blocks on this site, so I decided to use [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) from Microsoft. I love it! It looks so much better!

Here's how to do it using [Typography.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/typography-js/) in Gatsby. (That link also covers how to set up Typography; I won't be doing that here.)

First, go to [Cascadia's releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases) and download the font (if you don't like the ligatures, download Cascadia Code Mono). It's a TTF (TrueType font).

Copy the font file into wherever you're keeping your fonts. For me, it's in a `fonts` folder. Then, wherever you're putting your font CSS information (mine is `fonts.css` inside of that fonts folder), add the font family and refer to the file:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Cascadia Code';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: url('Cascadia.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-display: fallback;
}
```

In your `typography.js` file, add Cascadia to your fonts object. Mine looks like this now:

```js
export const fonts = {
  regular: 'Inter UI Regular',
  regularItalic: 'Inter UI Regular Italic',
  semibold: 'Inter UI Semibold',
  semiboldItalic: 'Inter UI Semibold Italic',
  bold: 'Inter UI Bold',
  boldItalic: 'Inter UI Bold Italic',
  monospace: 'Cascadia Code',
}
```

Be sure the string you give it matches the string you set for `font-family` exactly.

Voila! Now you can just set up your `pre` and `code` tags to use Cascadia for code in your articles! For example:

```css
code {
  font-size: 1.05rem;
  line-height: 1rem;
  background: lightgray;
  font-family: ${fonts.monospace};
}
```

Enjoy your beautiful new code blocks!
