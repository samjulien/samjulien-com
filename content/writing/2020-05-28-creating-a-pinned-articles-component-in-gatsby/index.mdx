import GatsbyBanner from '../../../src/components/GatsbyBanner'

<GatsbyBanner />

I wanted an easy way to pin articles to the front page of my website. It turns out Gatsby and GraphiQL make this process much easier than you'd think!

First, I added a new `pinned` field to the frontmatter of the articles I wanted to put on the front page and set it equal to `true`. Frontmatter fields are great for splicing, dicing, and sorting your content however you'd like.

I then fired up Gatsby's built-in GraphiQL tool and built the following query:

```graphql
query {
  allMdx(
    sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
    limit: 10
    filter: {
      frontmatter: { published: { ne: false }, pinned: { eq: true } }
      fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "//content/writing//" }
    }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        fields {
          title
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query finds the 10 most recent pinned articles and sorts them by date descending.

What's cool about using a filter of `pinned: { eq: true }` is that I don't have to go back and add this field to every single article. If I were to change the filter to `ne: false` like the filter for `published`, it would include articles that didn't include that field at all. This is because the filter will treat that null reference as a "truthy" value. I'm using the exact same principle in reverse with the `published` field: I can explicitly set it to `false` on articles I don't want published, but I don't have to remember to go back and flip that value to `true` to get them to show up.

I then created a `PinnedArticles` component and used my query with the `useStaticQuery` hook that Gatsby provides. Here's the finished component:

```jsx
// src/components/PinnedArticles.js
const PinnedArticles = () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      allMdx(
        sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
        limit: 10
        filter: {
          frontmatter: { published: { ne: false }, pinned: { eq: true } }
          fileAbsolutePath: { regex: "//content/writing//" }
        }
      ) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            fields {
              title
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.allMdx.edges.map((edge) => (
        <li key={edge.node.id}>
          <Link to={`/${edge.node.fields.slug}`}>{edge.node.fields.title}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default PinnedArticles
```

All that was left was to replace my hardcoded list of articles in `index.mdx` with my new `<PinnedArticles />` component:

```markdown
<!-- pages/index.mdx -->

## Some Favorites

These are what I'd considered my "foundational articles." They reflect some of the major lessons I've learned so far on my journey. If you're just getting to know me, start with these:

<PinnedArticles />
```

And that's it! Now any time I want to pin a new article to the front page, I just set that frontmatter field and I'm on my way.
